# Global Development Beeswarm Chart

This project demonstrates an interactive data visualization using D3.js, showcasing a beeswarm chart that dynamically represents various aspects of global development. The visualization allows users to explore data across different countries, years, and development indicators, providing insights into trends and patterns in global development metrics.

## Features

- **Dynamic Beeswarm Chart**: Visualize global development data as an interactive beeswarm chart.
- **Customizable Data Representation**: Choose different attributes for the x-axis and circle size, showcasing various development indicators.
- **Interactive Year Selection**: Browse through data by selecting different years or using a playback feature for animated transitions.
- **Region Selection**: Filter data by world regions, with options to select or deselect all regions.
- **Responsive Tooltip**: Hover over data points to view detailed information about each country, including the country's name, values for the x-axis and size attributes, and a representative image or icon.
- **Data Filtering**: Dynamically update the visualization based on user-selected criteria, such as regions, attributes, and years.
- **Staggered Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations provide a clear view of changes over time or when adjusting parameters.

## Technologies

- **D3.js**: Used for creating and manipulating the data-driven visualization.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling of the web page and controls.
- **JavaScript**: For handling interactivity and data processing.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling of controls.
